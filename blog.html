    <p class="font1"> We wish to show that in each iteration, u:d D ı.s; u/ for the vertex
      added to set S. For the purpose of contradiction, let u be the first vertex for
      which u:d ¤ ı.s; u/ when it is added to set S. We shall focus our attention
      on the situation at the beginning of the iteration of the while loop in which u
      is added to S and derive the contradiction that u:d D ı.s; u/ at that time by
      examining a shortest path from s to u. We must have u ¤ s because s is the
      first vertex added to set S and s:d D ı.s; s/ D 0 at that time. Because u ¤ s,
      we also have that S ¤ ; just before u is added to S. There must be some
      path from s to u, for otherwise u:d D ı.s; u/ D 1 by the no-path property,
      which would violate our assumption that u:d ¤ ı.s; u/. Because there is at
      least one path, there is a shortest path p from s to u. Prior to adding u to S,
      path p connects a vertex in S, namely s, to a vertex in V  S, namely u. Let us
      consider the first vertex y along p such that y 2 V  S, and let x 2 S be y’s
      predecessor along p. Thus, as Figure 24.7 illustrates, we can decompose path p
      into s ❀
      p1 x ! y ❀
      p2 u. (Either of paths p1 or p2 may have no edges.)
